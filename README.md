# Boomba Zoomba
A fun fight game with stick figure rag dolls. Play it at [boomba-zoomba.herokuapp.com](http://boomba-zoomba.herokuapp.com). Has single player (play against an AI) and multi player capabilities (using web sockets). 

If you want to add more hats of your own, check out the hat API in [the docs folder](https://github.com/N8python/BoombaZoomba/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info.
